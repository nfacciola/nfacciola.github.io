        <h2>Hi, I'm Nicholas Facciola</h2>
        <p>
          I am a software engineer with a focus on QA automation and data analysis, with hands-on experience building tools and workflows 
          that improve reliability and efficiency. At Intel, I created an e-temp recovery flow in C# for Panther Lake that turned failing extreme temp 
          units into commercial temp units, saving significant cost, and I developed a CI/CD pipeline to validate pull requests across test modules. 
          I also designed Python workflows to capture and analyze thermal test data on Meteor Lake and Bartlett Lake, 
          applying statistical methods to support engineering decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          What drives me is solving hard problems with creative solutions, and I take pride in being responsible, dependable, and 
          delivering on what I promise. Outside of work, I enjoy running, hiking, camping, and spending time with my cats â€” but above all, 
          I hope people remember me for my positive and professional attitude.
        </p>
